    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "Say that a factory produces four different products, and that the daily produced amount of the first product is x₁, the amount produced of the second product is x₂, and so on. The goal is to determine the profit-maximizing daily production amount for each product, bearing in mind the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The profit per unit of product is $20, $12, $40, and $25 for the first, second, third, and fourth product, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to manpower constraints, the total number of units produced per day can't exceed fifty.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each unit of the first product, three units of the raw material A are consumed. Each unit of the second product requires two units of the raw material A and one unit of the raw material B. Each unit of the third product needs one unit of A and two units of B. Finally, each unit of the fourth product requires three units of B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the transportation and storage constraints, the factory can consume up to one hundred units of the raw material A and ninety units of B per day.\n"

    "4. The third ineqlin: residual is 0, which means that the factory consumes all 90 units of the raw material B. This entire amount is consumed for the third product. That's why the factory can't produce the second or fourth product at all and can't produce more than 45 units of the third product. It lacks the raw material B."
